Hey, guys.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,970
So in the last lesson, we saw how Flexbox can be declared on a container and how it can start already

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,400
doing its thing based on the automatic default values.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,600
But in this lesson, I want to talk to you about something called flex direction so that we can actually

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,030
learn how to modify our Flexbox in order to achieve the layouts that we want.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:31,760
When we think about a default flow, normally items get laid out like this, so if they're inline,

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,960
they'll continue stacking inline until there is no more space.
